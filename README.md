# TIC_TAC_TOE-GAME

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built from scratch as a web application. This project features both a Player vs. Player mode and a challenging Player vs. Computer mode with a difficulty setting.

## Features

* **Player vs. Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same device.
* **Player vs. Computer Mode:** Test your skills against a computer opponent.
* **Difficulty Levels:** Choose between an "Easy" random-move AI or a challenging "Hard" AI that is nearly unbeatable.
* **Symbol Selection:** Players can choose to be 'X' or 'O'.
* **Modern UI/UX:** The interface has a clean, dark-themed design with smooth animations and intuitive navigation.
* **Responsive Design:** The game board and controls are optimized for various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
* **Game State Management:** The application accurately tracks the game board, player turns, and winning conditions.
* **Restart Functionality:** A simple restart button allows for quick new games.

## How to Play

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  On the home screen, select either "Player vs Player" or "Player vs Computer".
4.  If playing against the computer, choose your desired difficulty level.
5.  Select your symbol, 'X' or 'O'.
6.  Click on a cell to place your symbol. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If the board fills up and no one has won, the game is a draw.
7.  Use the "Restart Game" or "Change Options" buttons to start over or change settings.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the game's structure and layout.
* **CSS:** For styling the modern, responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** For the core game logic, including turn management, win/draw condition checks, and the AI implementation.

## My Development Process

I built this project to deepen my understanding of fundamental web development concepts. The main challenge was implementing the AI, especially the "Hard" difficulty, which required me to dive into the Minimax algorithm. It was a great learning experience in managing game state and creating a responsive, interactive user experience from scratch.

I'm happy with how the UI turned out and the polished feel of the game. Future plans might include adding a score tracker or an online multiplayer feature.
